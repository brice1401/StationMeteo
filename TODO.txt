** Genral :
-Do an evaluation on how to send data :
	* Radio on an other arduino
	* Wifi
	* 2.4 GHz
	* 2G/3G/4G and send them to a website

-Add more sensor :
	* More accurate humidity sensor
	* Barometric pressure
	* Lightning
	* Light
	* Battery level
	* UV
	* Radiation

- Send the Data to wunderground
	* use ethernet shield to send data to the web
	* 


** On the code :
	* recreate the function to code/decode message
	* transfer the function from datalogger to sensorcard and displayCard
	* create the code for ethernet shield and internet connexion


** Far away future **
- Add a solar panel and a Li-ion batery
- Create a stategy to put the arduino on sleep mode

* deal with include code library
